# Yeast (S. cerevisiae) glycolytic and fermentation enzymes
# Source: SGD pathway annotations
# Among the most highly expressed genes in yeast grown on glucose.
# Expected results: strong codon optimization (similar to RP genes), high
# wtAI in Mode 3, low FS transitions in Mode 4, synonymous-driven in Mode 5.
# Count: 17
