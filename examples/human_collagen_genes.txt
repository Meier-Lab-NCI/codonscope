# Human collagen genes
# Source: HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)
# Collagens have a characteristic Gly-X-Y tripeptide repeat, making them
# strongly enriched for glycine (~33% of residues vs ~7% genome average).
# Expected results: strong AA-driven signal in Mode 5 (Gly, Pro enriched),
# GGC/GGA/GGT codon enrichment in Mode 1, distinctive Mode 3 profile.
# Count: 21
