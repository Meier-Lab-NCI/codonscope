# Human integrated stress response (ISR) translationally upregulated genes (18 genes)

#     gene expression in mammalian cells', Mol Cell 6:1099-1108 (2000).

# These genes are translationally upregulated during ISR via uORF-mediated
# mechanisms (phospho-eIF2alpha -> selective translation of mRNAs with upstream
# open reading frames).
# Expected CodonScope results:
#   Mode 1: Distinct codon composition from 5'TOP genes
#   Mode 5: Different AA composition from highly expressed genes
#   NOTE: The translational upregulation of these genes is primarily driven by
#   uORF mechanisms in the 5'UTR, NOT by codon-specific effects. CodonScope
#   should show that their CDS codon usage is NOT what distinguishes them —
#   this is a useful NEGATIVE CONTROL for codon-level analysis. Any codon
#   enrichment seen likely reflects amino acid function, not translational
#   selection.
