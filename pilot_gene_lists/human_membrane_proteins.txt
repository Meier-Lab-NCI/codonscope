# Human transmembrane proteins — Mode 5 AA-driven test case (55 genes)
# Source: Curated from receptor tyrosine kinases, ion channels, transporters,
#   GPCRs, and tetraspanins.
# Reference: General protein structure literature on transmembrane domain
#   amino acid composition.
# Transmembrane proteins are enriched for hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Ile,
# Val, Phe, Trp, Ala) in their membrane-spanning domains. This amino acid
# composition difference should drive most of the codon usage signal.
# Expected CodonScope results:
#   Mode 5: Codon bias is predominantly AA-driven (hydrophobic amino acid
#     enrichment: Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, Trp for transmembrane domains), NOT
#     synonymous-driven. This tests Mode 5's ability to correctly attribute
#     codon bias to amino acid composition rather than synonymous choice.
#   Mode 1: Enrichment for codons encoding hydrophobic amino acids
#   Mode 3: May show distinctive optimality profile due to membrane insertion
#     pause sites
