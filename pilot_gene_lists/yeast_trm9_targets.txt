# Yeast genes with extreme AGA/GAA codon usage — Trm9 modification targets (50 genes)
# Source: Top 50 genes by combined AGA (Arg) + GAA (Glu) codon fraction,
#   computed from SGD CDS sequences (>=100 codons, >=3 Arg, >=3 Glu).
#   Based on the codon bias criterion from:
#   Begley U et al., 'Trm9-catalyzed tRNA modifications link translation to
#     the DNA damage response', Mol Cell 28:860-870 (2007).
# The Begley paper identified 425 "Group 1" genes with high AGA+GAA usage.
# This list selects the 50 most extreme (excluding small PAU seripauperin genes).
# Biological context:
#   Trm9 methyltransferase catalyses mcm5s2U modification at wobble position of
#   tRNA-Arg(UCU) and tRNA-Glu(UUC), enhancing decoding of AGA and GAA codons.
#   Under DNA damage (MMS), Trm9-dependent tRNA modification selectively
#   promotes translation of AGA/GAA-enriched genes — particularly RNR1/3
#   (ribonucleotide reductase) required for DNA repair.
# Overlap with other pilot lists:
#   ~20 of these are also in yeast_ribosomal_proteins.txt (RP genes are among
#   the most codon-optimized). Use the non-RP subset (glycolytic, translation
#   factors) for a complementary analysis.
# Expected CodonScope results:
#   Mode 1: Strong AGA and GAA enrichment; depletion of AGG, GAG, and rare
#     Arg codons (CGN family)
#   Mode 2: Very high demand — these are the highest-expressed yeast genes
#   Mode 5: Synonymous-driven signal (AGA preference within Arg, GAA within Glu)
#   Mode 3: High optimality throughout (highly expressed genes)
