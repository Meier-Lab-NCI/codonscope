# Yeast genes with >=90% TTG leucine codon usage — Trm4/m5C modification targets (39 genes)
# Source: Computed from SGD CDS sequences following the criterion in:
#   Chan CTY et al., 'A quantitative systems approach reveals dynamic control
#     of tRNA modifications during cellular stress', PLoS Genet 6:e1001247 (2010).
#   Chan CTY et al., 'Reprogramming of tRNA modifications controls the oxidative
#     stress response by codon-biased translation of proteins', Nat Commun
#     3:937 (2012).
# The paper reported 38 genes at >90% TTG threshold among 5,782 genes; our
# computation from 6,685 current SGD ORFs yields 39 (one borderline gene at
# exactly 90.0%, consistent with CDS annotation version differences).
# Biological context:
#   Under oxidative stress (H2O2), Trm4 methyltransferase increases m5C
#   modification at the wobble position of tRNA(Leu-CAA), enhancing decoding
#   of TTG codons. Genes with high TTG usage are selectively upregulated at
#   the translational level. RPL22A (100% TTG, 7/7 leucines) vs RPL22B (34%
#   TTG) is the key differential example from the paper.
# Expected CodonScope results:
#   Mode 1: Extreme TTG enrichment, depletion of other Leu codons (TTA, CTN)
#   Mode 2: Very high demand contribution — these are among the most highly
#     expressed yeast genes
#   Mode 3: High optimality throughout (most are RP/glycolytic genes)
#   Mode 5: Synonymous-driven signal (TTG preference within Leu family)
# Ribosomal protein genes (27)
