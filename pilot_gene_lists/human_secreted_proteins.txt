# Human highly secreted proteins (55 genes)
# Source: Curated from liver secretome, coagulation factors, complement,
#   immunoglobulins, collagens, and cytokines/growth factors.
# Reference: Zhou M et al., 'The Effects of Codon Usage on Protein Structure
#   and Folding', Annual Rev Biophys (2024).
# Co-translational folding and SRP-dependent translocation literature shows
# rare codons enriched in 5' ends of secreted proteins for membrane targeting.
# Expected CodonScope results:
#   Mode 3: Distinct ramp profile due to signal peptide and co-translational
#     translocation; the N-terminal signal peptide region may show different
#     optimality than the mature protein
#   Mode 5: AA-driven composition differences — enrichment for hydrophobic
#     signal peptide residues (Leu, Ala, Val) and secreted protein-specific
#     amino acids
#   Mode 1: Codon enrichment reflecting amino acid composition of secreted
#     proteins (e.g. Gly codons for collagen subfamily)
